# Data Visualization Projects

This repository is a collection of data visualization projects created using Python and Matplotlib. The main purpose of these projects is to practice and demonstrate how to represent data in a clear, informative, and visually appealing way.

## Overview

Data visualization is a key skill in data science, statistics, and engineering. Visualizing data helps to:

- Understand patterns and trends in datasets  
- Communicate insights effectively  
- Identify outliers and anomalies  
- Support decision-making based on data  

This repository focuses on using **Python’s Matplotlib library**, which is a powerful and flexible tool for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations. Through these projects, different types of plots and charts are explored, including line charts, bar charts, scatter plots, and multi-axis visualizations.

## Goals

The goals of this repository are:

1. **Learning by Doing** – Implement different types of visualizations to understand Python plotting techniques.  
2. **Showcasing Skills** – Create projects that can be shared in a portfolio to demonstrate practical data visualization abilities.  
3. **Data Interpretation** – Practice interpreting data visually to gain insights that may not be obvious from raw numbers.  
4. **Experimentation** – Explore advanced plotting features such as multiple axes, annotations, legends, color customization, and gridlines.  

## Getting Started

To run the projects in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.  
2. Install the required library:
```bash
pip install matplotlib
