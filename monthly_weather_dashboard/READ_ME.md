# Weather Data Visualization

This project visualizes daily weather data for a 30-day period, including **temperature, humidity, and rainfall**, using Python and Matplotlib. It also includes a **scatter plot with a regression line** to show the relationship between temperature and rainfall.

## Features

- Line plot of **daily temperature**.
- Line plot of **daily humidity**.
- Line plot of **daily rainfall**.
- Scatter plot of **temperature vs rainfall** with a **linear regression line** to show trends.

## Data

- **Days:** 1–30
- **Temperature (°C):** 30 days of sample temperature data.
- **Humidity (%):** 30 days of sample humidity data.
- **Rainfall (mm):** 30 days of sample rainfall data.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`
